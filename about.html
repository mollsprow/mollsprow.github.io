		 <p>Over 15 years experience in the web world. I've seen the rise and fall of Geocities, YTMND, and pets.com.</p>
		 
		 <h3>My Story</h3>
		 
		 <p>Started off thinking I wanted to be a graphic designer. Then video games got cooler, and animation took over. Turns out that is really
		 tedious and I have little patience. Decided to try to be a jack of all trades. Learned HTML at Temple University in my digital media concentration and got hooked. 
		 Landed a sweet internship at a small company called ID Partners, where an amazing developer helped me hone those skills, and helped me learn light JS and 
		 CSS. There I worked on all of their digital assets including photography for their web stores, design and upkeep of their web portals, and packaging for Microsoft conference giveaways.
		</p>
		
		<p>Unfortunately that company was sold off. I was lucky enough then to land a job working with another amazing person who helped me
		hone my design and coding skills working on medical and hospital websites. From there I moved on to work at Dow Jones and the Wall Street Journal as 
		a rapid prototyper of financial products. During one of their famous organizational changes I moved on to a privately owned company designing and coding front end for commercial websites and online 
		applications. Eventually I landed a gig at Educational Testing Services, where the bulk of my work is designing and maintaining materials for the 
		Department of Education - namely the National Assessment of Educational Progress.</p>
		
		<p>In my free time I like to play video, card and board games, play with my dog, and try to travel to as many places as possible while 
		eating as many different kinds of foods as possible. I do a bit of light crafting and gardening, I love to catch and eat all kinds of fish, 
		camp, and make as many things as I can using matcha (Japenese powdered green tea). I would like to retire in Alaska.
